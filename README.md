# Stretch Activity "Advanced #2":

Given an array with numbers, write a program that efficiently answers queries of the form: “Which is the nearest *larger-than* value for the number at position i?”, where distance is the difference in array indices. For example in the array `[1,4,3,2,5,7]`, the nearest *larger-than* value for `4` is `5`.

Optional: After linear time preprocessing you should be able to answer queries in constant time.
